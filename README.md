## Note!

**DO NOT** clone the `dev` branch. Currently, only I am developing this branch. Sometimes I use --force to push, and I set the rule that only I can push on this branch. You are supposed to fork the `main` branch and create pull request.

~~Because I am lazy~~, I have not create a forked repository and I develop it on the same repository. If you want to be a contributor, please contact me by email.
