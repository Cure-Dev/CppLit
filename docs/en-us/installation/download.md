# Download The Lit Project

It's a simple way to download The Lit Project and use it out of the box. In this article I will show you how to download The Lit Project and configure it in various platforms.

## From GitHub Releases

Go to <https://github.com/litlang/cpplit/releases>, and download the artifact of your platform. The format is `<os>-<cpu-arch>-<os-bit-arch>`.  
Or you can go to <https://lit.cure-x.net>. (if auto-detect is really required, i will add it.)

## From Debian Package

## From Apt Sources
